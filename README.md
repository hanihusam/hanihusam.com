# nextjs-typescript-quickstart

> Get started on Next.js with TypeScript in seconds.

This is an example setup of Next.js building on top of the [official TypeScript example](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/master/examples/with-typescript). It adds the following:

- Simple styling structure with [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)
- Basic ESLint and Prettier setup
- TypeScript typechecking as part of `test` script (ready to plug into any CI)

## How to use

[Download the example](https://github.com/resir014/nextjs-typescript-quickstart/archive/master.zip) and then unzip it.

Install it and run:

```bash
yarn
yarn dev
# or
npm install
npm run dev
```
